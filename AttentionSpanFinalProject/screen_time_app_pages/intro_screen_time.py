    This project is an attempt towards explaining the phenomenon of shortening attention spans in both children and adults,
    using insights derived from 2 comprehensive survey datasets found on Kaggle. In an increasingly digital world, understanding
    how screen time habits, device usage, and various activities impact our ability to focus is crucial.

    Through a series of interactive visualizations, we explore correlations between screen time, age groups,
    productivity, and attention metrics. Our goal is to shed light on potential trends and provide data-driven
    perspectives on this contemporary challenge.
