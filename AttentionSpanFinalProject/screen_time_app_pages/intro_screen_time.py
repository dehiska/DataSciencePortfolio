    This interactive portfolio showcases an in-depth analysis of screen time habits from a survey.
    We explore various aspects, including:

    * **Demographics:** How screen time varies across different age groups and genders.
    * **Purpose:** The distribution of screen time for educational vs. recreational uses.
    * **Impact:** Investigating potential correlations between screen time, attention span, and productivity.
    * **Device Usage:** Insights into preferred devices and activities.

    st.markdown("""
    This project is based on a simulated dataset reflecting survey responses on daily screen time.
    The primary data sources include:

    * `data.csv`: Contains general survey responses, including age, gender, productivity, and attention span.
    * `screen_time.csv`: Details specific screen time hours broken down by age, gender, purpose (educational/recreational), and day type (weekday/weekend).

    All data loading and initial preprocessing for the visualizations are handled efficiently using Streamlit's caching mechanisms.
