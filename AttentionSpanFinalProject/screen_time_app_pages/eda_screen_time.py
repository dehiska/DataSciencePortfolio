    This section briefly outlines the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process for the Screen Time project.
    Our EDA focused on understanding the distributions, relationships, and basic statistics of key survey responses
    before diving into specific visualizations.

    Key aspects of EDA included:
    * **Distribution of Screen Time:** How many hours do different age groups spend on screens?
    * **Device Preferences:** Which devices are most commonly used for various activities?
    * **Productivity Self-Assessment:** How do individuals perceive their own productivity levels?
    * **Attention Span Groupings:** Initial understanding of reported attention spans.
