This project demonstrates the use of open-source geospatial software packages like GeoPandas and Folium to create an interactive map visualizing Seattle housing prices. By leveraging these powerful tools, I was able to transform raw data into a meaningful and insightful map, showcasing my skills in geospatial data analysis.
